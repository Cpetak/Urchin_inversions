# Code to recreate figure 1.

The figure with the MDS spikes and the PCA subplots.

Data for this plot was created by code described in the [Part 1 markdown.](https://github.com/Cpetak/Urchin_inversions/blob/main/Part_1.md)
MDS figures and PCAs can be found in the intermediary_files directory.
I put these together into one plot using Inkscape.

For remaking the PCA and MDS plots, data can be read and plot can be plotted: [fig1_recreate.py](https://github.com/Cpetak/Urchin_inversions/blob/main/fig1_recreate.py)
