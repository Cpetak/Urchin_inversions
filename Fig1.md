#Code to recreate figure 1.

The figure with the MDS spikes and the PCA subplots.

Data for this plot was created by code described in the [Part 1 markdown.](https://github.com/Cpetak/Urchin_inversions/blob/main/Part_1.md)

For adjusting the figure, data can be read and plot can be plotted: TODO

This will make the PCAs and the MDS plots, I put them together using Inkscape.
