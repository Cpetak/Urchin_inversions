# Finding and investigating chromosomal inversions in the purple sea urchin

This is a cleaned git repo containing code needed to recreate our results.

## Part 1

Steps and code for:

- Finding putative inversions using local PCA
- Identifying breakpoints
- Grouping individuals based on karyotype
- Looking for correlation with latitude

can be found in [this markdown.](https://github.com/Cpetak/Urchin_inversions/blob/main/Part_1.md)

## Part 2

Steps and code for:

- Fst calculation between homokaryotype groups
- Linkage disequilibrium calculation
- Nucleotide diversity

can be found in [this markdown.](https://github.com/Cpetak/Urchin_inversions/blob/main/Part_2.md)
